Personal Website using Three.JS. I imported models from free online sources and used them to create a sunset scene with birds, a horizon, sun, and clouds. Using raycasting (shining a light from the user to determine cursor position), I enabled the 3d clouds to be interactable objects that lead you to my subpages. WIP!
